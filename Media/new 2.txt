 For years, part of my daily routine has been to listen to the Reverend, Doctor's 
radio program in the morning because he make's a good faith effort to present all 
sides of the issues while exhorting his listeners to do their own research albeit 
his team's phenomenal research is firmly based on demonstrable facts. Although 
desiring to do so, I considered subscribing to the BlazeTV as an unnecessary luxury 
since I'm living on Social (in)Security.
 But then the Ministry of Truth(Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter) decided to
vaporize America's Frontline Doctors and throw their video into the memory hole.
God help us! The Reverend, Doctor is right! 1984 is metamorphosing from fiction 
to current events. And this is not going to be a pretty butterfly.
 What was once an unnecessary luxury has become an indispensable necessity to arm
ourselves against the Woke Party and Big Brother, consequently I bought a year's 
subscription.
  Question, has Trump become Goldstein? Rather than the daily Two Minutes of Hate 
we have thirty minutes of hate, but it's called the nightly news.

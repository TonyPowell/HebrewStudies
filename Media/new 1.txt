Family Search is the Mormon system and is free to anyone who wants an account.

 
I have set one up for Elaine’s family that documents ancestry for both the Nelsons and the Andersons.

To see it, go to familysearch.org. The username: quiltedelaine@gmail.com. Password: Petain318.

Before creating the account in Family Search, I created the attached spreadsheet using information I had to get started and compare with the info that system already has on your family.

Click on Family Tree at top left then Tree. You will see the chart created in that system. You can increase the view with the plus sign on the left. Eugene Nelson begins the Nelson family ancestry. You will see Amelia and Edward Nelson. By clicking on “children” for them, you will see your mom listed. All of this was in the system and added automatically. Your and Mickey’s name have not been added but can be by you or anyone who goes into the system. If the information has not been verified, a red marker may be attached.   

If you click on the arrows going to the right, you can access the previous generations over hundreds of years – unless you reach a dead end.

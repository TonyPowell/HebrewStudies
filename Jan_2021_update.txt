 Added the column HEBREW_NO_NIQQUD to the HEBREW_AUDIO table which is simply the
HEBREW column of the table stripped of the niqqud. This seemed the simplest 
solution to the problem of searching the HEBREW_AUDIO table without having to
know the correct niqqud for the Hebrew. 
 Updated the functions search_audio_table, add_audio_to_db and the 
"Save changes to displayed Audio" code of the execute_audio_option function 
to accomodate the new HEBREW_NO_NIQQUD column added to the HEBREW_AUDIO table.
